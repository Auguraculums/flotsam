Stellar-to-Twitter

Turn your Stellar flow into a Twitter timeline using Ruby as follows:

1. Create a new Twitter account, like I did at http://twitter.com/mattb_stellar - to be polite, make it a protected account so that its retweets don't annoy anyone.
2. Rename config.yml.example to config.yml and edit it with your Stellar username, and valid OAuth credentials for the Twitter account
3. gem install twitter ruby-oembed redis
4. Make sure you have a redis instance running on localhost
5. Run 'ruby stellar2twitter.rb' regularly using cron

Tweets from your flow will be retweeted, and all other media will be inspected via OEmbed services to get the right title and author for a tweet pointing to them.
